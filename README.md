# Sox vs Cubs
### This was a statistics project done in Kalamazoo College with another classmate/friend An-Ting Chu. 
### As for the baseball fans you guessed it. The goal is to predict which of the Chicago baseball teams will have a better chance of taking the tryphy home for Chicago. Please DO NOT use these data as a way to be reliable for real life.
### The CUBS_WHITESOX folder contains all the files of the entire project including the final report, raw data, and the R-file.
